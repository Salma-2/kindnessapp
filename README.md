The Kindness Android App
Kindness Charity Android Application

3. Put your phone Number into the EditText and select your country's code (It's selected automatically but can be
used manually) note: the country code picker is an open source API not made by the team.
4. The app uses firebase authentication using phone-number so it sends verification code to the user and the app
validates the credentials
5. User must sign up on first time to access the app and its features also in sign up process an account for the
user with registeration info is placed into firebase real time database as an object called User.
6. In registeration process user has to verify his identity by uploading national Id or any identity card.
7. The identity card photo is uploaded to firebase storage.
8. After finishing sign-in or sign-up process categories (fields of help) are downloaded through firebase realtime
 database into a listView using custom list adapter, categories can be updated or modified by adding or removing any
of the categories online from the database and the app updates itself automatically to recieve changes from the data-
base.
9. Each category has category id so when clicking on "post" for posting user's problem or on "view" to view user's 
problems, this id is sent through an intent to the next activity so the problems associated with this category id
are displayed or added (also through realtime firebase database)
